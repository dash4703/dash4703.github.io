<title>What about WallStreetBets</title>

<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>TL;DR version is that Wall Street bros started losing at their own game to a bunch of civilians after one guy taught everyone how the whole fake system works. 
r/WallStreetBets is being used in this instance as a revolutionary organization tool. They coordinated an attack on the 1%. From the context of a lot of memes, I've learned that this attack was very personal for some. A lot of us watched our parents go through hard times after Wall Street bailouts in 2008. Having been too young to understand or take any action then, the kids of the parents who lost everything at the hands of Wall Street have come for their revenge.</p>
