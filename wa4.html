<p> The Disney+ original series WandaVision is the streaming service's greatest show to date. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it is actively laying the foundation for the next phase of the MCU. Since it's premeire on January 15, 2021 WandaVision has become one of the most watched shows ever, and is currently the most popular show in the world. </p>

<p> WandaVision broke records for Disney+ over its premiere weekend. According to <a href="https://blog.reelgood.com/wandavision-tops-stranger-things-the-mandalorian-in-opening-weekend-engagement" target="blank"> Reelgood's data for January 15-17</a> it was the most watched shows across all streaming services. Prior to WandaVision, Disney's most in-demand show was the Mandalorian. As we can see from Nielsen's data (shown above) that WandaVision has surpassed the Mandalorian in its first weekend alone. Insert graph. 
Here I will use opening weekend as argument that this is most popular show in the world. </p>

<p> Additionally, WandaVision has made a huge impact on Disney+, bringing in more subscribers than previous quarters. <img src="displus_data.png" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;" class="center"> </p>

<p> This fourth paragraph will be my third and final point. Easter eggs maybe? Consider the new lineup of MCU movies and shows </p>

<p> Finally, I will conclude my argument here. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it will set the basis for the next phase of the MCU because of the reasons I just explained above. WandaVision is currently the<a href="https://screenrant.com/wandavision-world-most-popular-show-marvel-disney/" target="blank"> most popular show</a> in the world.</p>
