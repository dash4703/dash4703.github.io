<p> The Disney+ original series WandaVision is the streaming service's greatest show to date. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it is actively laying the foundation for the next phase of the MCU. Since it's premeire on January 15, 2021 WandaVision has become one of the most watched shows ever.  </p>

<p> WandaVision broke records for Disney+ over its premiere weekend. According to <a href="https://blog.reelgood.com/wandavision-tops-stranger-things-the-mandalorian-in-opening-weekend-engagement" target="blank"> Reelgood's data for January 15-17</a> it was the most watched shows across all streaming services. 
This second paragraph will be the first point in my argument. Turning multimedia into the multiverse; recently acquired rights to X-Men leading to the need for a plot device to unite all our heroes </p>

<p> This third paragraph will be the second point. Probably something about WandaVision being the most watched show, or at least a very popular one (insert dataset and/or stat here) </p>

<p> This fourth paragraph will be my third and final point. Easter eggs maybe? Consider the new lineup of MCU movies and shows </p>

<p> Finally, I will conclude my argument here. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it will set the basis for the next phase of the MCU because of the reasons I just explained above. </p>
