<p> I am going to write about WandaVision... This first paragraph will introduce what the show is about and what my argument around it is. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it is actively laying the foundation for the next phase of the MCU.</p>

<p> This second paragraph will be the first point in my argument. Turning multimedia into the multiverse; recently acquired rights to X-Men leading to the need for a plot device to unite all our heroes </p>

<p> This third paragraph will be the second point. Probably something about WandaVision being the most watched show, or at least a very popular one (insert dataset and/or stat here) </p>

<p> This fourth paragraph will be my third and final point. Easter eggs maybe? Consider the new lineup of MCU movies and shows </p>

<p> Finally, I will conclude my argument here. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it will set the basis for the next phase of the MCU because of the reasons I just explained above. </p>
