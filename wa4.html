<p> I am going to write about WandaVision... This first paragraph will introduce what the show is about and what my argument around it is. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it is actively laying the foundation for the next phase of the MCU.</p>

<p> This second paragraph will be the first point in my argument. </p>

<p> This third paragraph will be the second point. </p>

<p> This fourth paragraph will be my third and final point. </p>

<p> Finally, I will conclude my argument here. WandaVision is a great show and I believe it will set the basis for the next phase of the MCU because of the reasons I just explained above. </p>
